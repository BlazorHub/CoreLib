# CoreLib

Consider this library as a quick start into a productivity boost
to achieve your stated development goal faster.

This library privides field-proven code solutions to everyday problems
without adding additional 3rd-party dependencies. It's **open source** and 
**completely free**. So you can use it (or parts of it) in your projects, 
whether they are open source or not.

A core library unfolds its maximum effectiveness for you, if you are 
occupied with the offered solutions and use them again and again.
So, ideally, you should use this core library in all projects to with the
goal to **reuse as much code as possible**!
